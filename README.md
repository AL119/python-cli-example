# Python CLI Example
A small Python CLI example you can use to build on. With an emphasis on Linux and creating automation tools that solve a problem for you. THis is the basis for DevOps principles that you can apply in your own environment as well as production environments.

## Setting up the environment
Python development will require you to have Python installed on your system. For Linux systems, you should prefer the Python that comes available through the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Python with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3
``` 

The _update_ part is required if this is a fresh install of the system. Any Python version above 3.6 should work well for this repository, its examples, and most of the work shown in the video course.

The course uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) exclusively, but you can use any other text editor as well. 

These are all the tools and editor extensions recommended for Python development:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
- [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
